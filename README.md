# 🧭 Himanshu's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio — a crafted blend of creativity, technology, and storytelling.  
This project reflects not just my frontend skills but also the vision I bring into building immersive digital experiences.  
Everything here is custom-built using **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced with **Framer Motion** and **Lenis smooth scrolling** for a cinematic user feel.
