# 🧭 Himanshu's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio — a crafted blend of creativity, technology, and storytelling.  
This project reflects not just my frontend skills but also the vision I bring into building immersive digital experiences.  
Everything here is custom-built using **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and enhanced with **Framer Motion** and **Lenis smooth scrolling** for a cinematic user feel.

## 🎯 Vision Behind This Portfolio

This portfolio isn’t just a website — it’s a representation of how I think, code, and design.
Every animation, scroll, and color transition has purpose.
It’s about balancing functionality and feeling — showing how frontend can tell stories as much as it can deliver interfaces.

## 💬 Final Note

“Good design is where code meets emotion — and that’s the art I chase every day.”

— Himanshu
